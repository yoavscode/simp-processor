# Simple Processor (SIMP) Assembler and Simulator

This repository contains a simple processor (SIMP) assembler and simulator developed as part of the Computer Organization course project. The SIMP assembler converts assembly code written in the SIMP instruction set architecture (ISA) into machine code, while the simulator executes the machine code on a simulated SIMP processor.

## Features
Assembler: Converts SIMP assembly code into machine code for execution on the SIMP processor.
Simulator: Executes machine code generated by the assembler on a simulated SIMP processor.
Instruction Set Architecture: Supports a simplified set of instructions for arithmetic, control flow, and memory operations.
Error Handling: Provides informative error messages for syntax errors and invalid instructions.
Debugging: Supports step-by-step execution with the ability to view register and memory values at each step.

## Usage
* Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yoavscode/simp-processor.git
* Create new project in Visual Studio and build asm.c
* Run the assembler: asm.exe program.asm memin.txt
* Run the simulator: sim.exe, asm.exe, fibo.asm, memin.txt, diskin.txt, irq2in.txt, memout.txt, regout.txt, trace.txt, hwregtrace.txt, cycles.txt, leds.txt, display7seg.txt, diskout.txt, monitor.txt

This repository also includes three sample assembly files (fibo.asm, square.asm, disktest.asm) to demonstrate the functionality of the assembler and simulator. You can use these files as a reference or create your own assembly code to run on the SIMP processor.
